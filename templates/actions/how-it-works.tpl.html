			<h4>Slicing &amp; Conversion</h4>
			<p>Once you have submitted the order form, you will receive an email with login details to our client area. We slice up your designs into optimized and cross-browser compatible XHTML and CSS and will have them ready within one to five days depending on the chosen completion time. As soon as the design is sliced we will upload a preview and you will be able to review it.</p>
